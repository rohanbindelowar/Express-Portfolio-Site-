# Express-Portfolio-Site-
Portfolio Website using Express
This website consists of five main pages: Home, About Me, Projects, Services, and Contact Me.
Within the "view/partials" folder, you'll find several EJS files connected to the "view/index.ejs" file.
When the code runs, the controller responds with the "index.ejs" file. I've employed if-else conditions to ensure the correct responses from the partials folder.
If you have any suggestions for improvements in my code, please feel free to share them. You can reach me at my email address, 
which is rohanbindelowar@gmail.com.
If you'd like further clarification or have any specific requests, please let me know!
